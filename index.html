            <p>
                Humanity is facing a wildlife crisis. Animals around the world are threatened by habitat destruction, and a rising demand for wildlife products has led to massive poaching and trafficking.Each year over 30,000 elephants are poached for their ivory; just
                4% of wild tigers remain compared to a century ago.

            <p>
                The global wildlife trade is big business and the industry is worth billions annually. The U.S. is the largest importer of wildlife and wildlife products on record. The market for wild animals and animal products comes with a significant risk to wildlife
                worldwide due to extinction, spread of disease and the introduction of invasive species into delicate ecosystems.
